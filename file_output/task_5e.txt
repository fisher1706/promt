B) Email body in Markdown:

Hi Team,

Thank you all for your valuable contributions in our recent meetings! Here’s a concise summary of
our discussions along with the next steps.

### Meeting Summaries
- **12 August 2023**: The team outlined the requirements for the web-based to-do app, focusing on
core functionality like task creation and user-friendly design, while discussing the tech stack for
the frontend and backend.
- **18 December 2023**: Customer feedback led to the suggestion of adding a task assignment feature
for better collaboration. The team decided to postpone this feature to maintain the current project
timeline.
- **5 February 2024**: Concerns were raised about app performance with multiple users. The team
explored potential solutions, such as implementing caching and considering a transition to Redis for
better data management to enhance performance.

### Next Steps
- Prototype the Redis approach to assess performance feasibility (Raj, Mia)
- Document requirements for the assignment feature for a future release (Bob)
- Revisit app performance progress in two weeks (All)
