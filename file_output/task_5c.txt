C) Notes:
- There was no indication of any participant remaining neutral in discussions, as each contributed
ideas, critiques, or support. Their roles were defined through active participation which made
identifying neutral roles unnecessary.
- The effectiveness of proposals was assessed based on discussions, with nuanced views from
participants particularly around the implications of new feature implementations.
